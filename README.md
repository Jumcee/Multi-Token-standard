# Multi-Token-standard
ERC-1155 Token

This standard allows you to create fungible and non-fungible tokens using the same contract, significantly cutting down minting and transfer fees.

we'll be making use of this tools: MetaMask, Solidity, Hardhat, Alchemy, and OpenZeppelin Contracts to develop and deploy our contract.
